codey is the name of my command-line tool for putting LLMs on the command line.

i'd like to create an easter egg. code is actually a beaver named "codey
beaver". the command "codey beaver" should output a beaver ASCII art and a fun
message.

can you please give me a beaver ASCII art and a fun message that fits the theme
of "codey beaver"?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Here's a fun idea for your "Codey Beaver" Easter egg in your command-line tool.
Below is a simple but charming beaver ASCII art and a playful message that ties
into the theme of coding and beavers (known for their industrious nature and
building skills).

### Beaver ASCII Art

```
      ___
     (o)>
     /|_
    /  _>
   /_/
  /_/
 /__/
/___/
```

### Fun Message

"Hey there! I'm Codey Beaver, the hardest-working coder in the dam! I chew
through bugs and build robust code structures. Let's gnaw on some problems
together!"

### Explanation

- The ASCII art represents a beaver with a cute face and a tail, keeping it
  simple yet recognizable for a command-line output.
- The message plays on beaver traits (chewing, building dams) and coding
  (debugging, building software). Itâ€™s lighthearted and ties into the idea of
  "Codey" being a helpful, industrious companion.

Feel free to tweak the art or message to match the tone of your tool! If you'd
like a more detailed ASCII art or a different vibe for the message, just let me
know. ðŸ˜Š

### Implementation Tip

In your command-line tool, you can check if the input is `codey beaver`
(case-insensitive, if you want), and then print this art and message. For
example, in Python:

```python
if command.lower() == "codey beaver":
    print("""
       ___
      (o)>
      /|_
     /  _>
    /_/
   /_/
  /__/
 /___/
    """)
    print("Hey there! I'm Codey Beaver, the hardest-working coder in the dam! I chew through bugs and build robust code structures. Let's gnaw on some problems together!")
```

# === USER ===

can you please make the beaver art bigger and more detailed?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Here's a larger and more detailed ASCII art for Codey Beaver. This version
includes more features like a clearer face, body, tail, and even a little hint
of a dam or wood-chewing action to emphasize the beaver's industrious nature.
I've also kept the fun message the same, but feel free to modify it if you'd
like.

              /| \
             / |  \
            /  |   \
           /___|____\
          /    |     \

/______________|_______________\
|  Codey Beaver at work!  |  ~~
|  Chewing through code!  |  ~~
```

### Fun Message

"Hey there! I'm Codey Beaver, the hardest-working coder in the dam! I chew
through bugs and build robust code structures. Let's gnaw on some problems
together!"

### Explanation

- The ASCII art now shows a larger beaver with distinct eyes, a snout, arms,
  legs, and a prominent flat tail (a key beaver feature). I've added a little
  "dam" or "wood" base at the bottom with a playful note about Codey being at
  work, tying into the coding theme.
- The art is more detailed but still fits well in a command-line interface
  without being overly complex or too wide.
- The message remains the same, as it complements the visual of Codey "working"
  on something.

### Implementation Tip

As before, you can implement this in your command-line tool by checking for the
`codey beaver` command and printing the art and message. Here's an example in
Python:

```python
if command.lower() == "codey beaver":
    print("""
              ___
             (o.o)
              /| \\
             / |  \\
            /  |   \\
           /___|____\\
          /    |     \\
         /     |      \\
        /      |       \\
       /       |        \\
      /        |         \\
     /_________|__________\\
    /          |           \\
   /           |            \\
  /____________|_____________\\
 /             |              \\
/______________|_______________\\
|  Codey Beaver at work!  |  ~~
|  Chewing through code!  |  ~~
    """)
    print("Hey there! I'm Codey Beaver, the hardest-working coder in the dam! I chew through bugs and build robust code structures. Let's gnaw on some problems together!")
```

If you'd like an even larger or differently styled beaver (e.g., holding a
laptop or with more dam details), or if you want the message adjusted, just let
me know! ðŸ˜Š

# === USER ===

that doesn't really look like a beaver. can you try again? please make it look
like a beaver.

# === ASSISTANT ===

I apologize that the previous ASCII art didn't quite capture the essence of a
beaver. Let's try again with a more recognizable design. Beavers are known for
their rounded bodies, flat tails, prominent front teeth, and small ears. I'll
focus on those features in this larger, more detailed ASCII art to make it
clearly resemble a beaver. I'll also keep the fun message the same unless you
request a change.

### Revised Detailed Beaver ASCII Art

```
            _____
           /     \\
          /  o o  \\
         (    ^    )

  /____/  Codey     \____\
 /____/   Beaver!    \____\
/____/ Chewing Code!  \____\
```

### Fun Message

"Hey there! I'm Codey Beaver, the hardest-working coder in the dam! I chew
through bugs and build robust code structures. Let's gnaw on some problems
together!"

### Explanation

- **Head**: The head is rounded with small eyes (`o o`), a nose/mouth area (`^`)
  to suggest the prominent front teeth beavers are known for, and a general cute
  expression.
- **Body**: The body is stout and rounded, typical of a beaver's build, shown by
  the curved sides.
- **Tail**: The flat, wide tail is emphasized at the bottom with a broad,
  paddle-like shape (`\____\`), a distinctive beaver trait.
- **Labels**: I've included small text labels under the tail to tie it to "Codey
  Beaver" and the coding theme with "Chewing Code!" to mimic a beaver chewing
  wood.
- This design should be more recognizable as a beaver while still fitting in a
  command-line interface. It's larger and more detailed than the first attempt
  but not overly complex.

### Implementation Tip

Here's how you can implement this in your command-line tool (example in Python):

```python
if command.lower() == "codey beaver":
    print("""
                  _____
                 /     \\
                /  o o  \\
               (    ^    )
                \\  \\_/  /
                 \\     /
                  )___(
                 /     \\
                /  / \\  \\
               /  /   \\  \\
              /  /     \\  \\
             /__/       \\__\\
            /____/     \\____\\
           /____/       \\____\\
          /____/         \\____\\
         /____/           \\____\\
        /____/  Codey     \\____\\
       /____/   Beaver!    \\____\\
      /____/ Chewing Code!  \\____\\
    """)
    print("Hey there! I'm Codey Beaver, the hardest-working coder in the dam! I chew through bugs and build robust code structures. Let's gnaw on some problems together!")
```

If this still doesn't look like a beaver to you, or if you'd like specific
adjustments (e.g., adding paws, a piece of wood in its mouth, or a different
pose), please let me know! I can also search for or adapt other ASCII art styles
if you'd prefer. Additionally, if you'd like a more side-profile view (common
for beavers to show the tail better), I can try that too. Just give me some
feedback on what you'd like to see! ðŸ˜Š

# === USER ===

using commander in node.js, how do i make sure my option is required?

```typescript
program
  .command("chat")
  .argument(
    "[input]",
    "Prompt text to send to the LLM (optional; can be piped)",
  )
  .option("--file [file]", "Markdown file to use as context (required)");
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

In Commander.js (a popular library for building command-line applications in
Node.js), you can make an option required by using the `.requiredOption()`
method instead of `.option()`. This ensures that the user must provide the
specified option when running the command; otherwise, Commander will throw an
error and display a helpful message.

Below, I'll show how to modify your code to make the `--file` option required
for the `chat` command.

### Updated Code with Required Option

```typescript
const { Command } = require("commander");
const program = new Command();

program
  .command("chat")
  .argument(
    "[input]",
    "Prompt text to send to the LLM (optional; can be piped)",
  )
  .requiredOption("--file <file>", "Markdown file to use as context (required)")
  .action((input, options) => {
    // Your logic here
    console.log(`Input: ${input || "No input provided"}`);
    console.log(`File: ${options.file}`);
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

### Explanation

1. **`.requiredOption()`**: Replaces `.option()` to mark the `--file` option as
   mandatory. If the user does not provide this option when running the `chat`
   command, Commander will throw an error.
2. **`--file <file>`**: The `<file>` syntax (with angle brackets) indicates that
   a value is required for this option. This is different from `[file]` (with
   square brackets), which would make the value optional. Since it's a required
   option, `<file>` is appropriate.
3. **Error Handling**: If the user runs `codey chat` without `--file`, Commander
   will automatically output an error like:
   ```
   error: required option '--file <file>' not specified
   ```
   This ensures the user knows they need to provide the option.

### Example Usage

- Valid command:

  ```bash
  node codey.js chat --file context.md
  ```

  Output (based on the action):

  ```
  Input: No input provided
  File: context.md
  ```

- Invalid command (missing required option):
  ```bash
  node codey.js chat
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  error: required option '--file <file>' not specified
  ```

### Notes

- If you're using TypeScript, ensure you have the correct typings for
  Commander.js installed (`@types/commander` or similar, though Commander has
  built-in TypeScript support in recent versions).
- If you want to provide a default value for `--file` (which would make it
  technically not required), you can use `.option()` with `.default()` instead
  of `.requiredOption()`. However, since you explicitly want it required, stick
  with `.requiredOption()`.

### Full Example in TypeScript

Here's a more complete example with TypeScript, including error handling and
type definitions:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node

import { Command } from "commander";

const program = new Command();

program
  .name("codey")
  .description("A command-line tool for interacting with LLMs")
  .version("1.0.0");

program
  .command("chat")
  .description("Chat with the LLM using a prompt and context file")
  .argument(
    "[input]",
    "Prompt text to send to the LLM (optional; can be piped)",
  )
  .requiredOption("--file <file>", "Markdown file to use as context (required)")
  .action((input: string, options: { file: string }) => {
    console.log(`Input: ${input || "No input provided"}`);
    console.log(`File: ${options.file}`);
    // Add your LLM interaction logic here
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

This setup ensures that the `--file` option is required for the `chat` command.
If you have any other questions about Commander.js or want to add more features
(like custom error messages or additional options), let me know! ðŸ˜Š

how do i use the node.js api to read in the file contents?

```typescript
import { readStdin } from "../util/stdin.js";

export async function handleLog(
  input: string | undefined,
  opts: { file?: string } = { file: "codey.md" },
) {
  let promptText = input;
  if (!promptText && !process.stdin.isTTY) {
    promptText = (await readStdin()).trim();
  }
  if (!promptText) {
    console.error("No prompt supplied (argument or stdin required).");
    process.exit(1);
  }
  // read file
}
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

To read the contents of a file in Node.js, you can use the built-in `fs` (File
System) module, which provides methods for interacting with the file system.
Since you're working in TypeScript, I'll show you how to read the file contents
asynchronously using `fs.promises` (the Promise-based API) to keep your code
clean and modern. I'll integrate this into your `handleLog` function to read the
file specified in `opts.file`.

Below, I'll update your code to read the file contents and handle potential
errors (e.g., if the file doesn't exist or can't be read).

### Updated Code to Read File Contents

```typescript
import { readStdin } from "../util/stdin.js";
import { promises as fs } from "fs"; // Import the Promise-based fs API

export async function handleLog(
  input: string | undefined,
  opts: { file: string } = { file: "codey.md" }, // Changed to required, no optional
) {
  let promptText = input;
  if (!promptText && !process.stdin.isTTY) {
    promptText = (await readStdin()).trim();
  }
  if (!promptText) {
    console.error("No prompt supplied (argument or stdin required).");
    process.exit(1);
  }

  // Read file contents
  let fileContent: string;
  try {
    fileContent = await fs.readFile(opts.file, "utf-8");
    console.log(`Successfully read file: ${opts.file}`);
    // You can now use fileContent in your logic
    console.log(
      `File contents (first 100 chars): ${fileContent.slice(0, 100)}...`,
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error reading file ${opts.file}:`, error.message);
    process.exit(1);
  }

  // Continue with your logic using promptText and fileContent
  console.log(`Prompt: ${promptText}`);
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Import `fs.promises`**:
   - `import { promises as fs } from 'fs';` imports the Promise-based version of
     the `fs` module, which allows you to use `await` with file operations like
     `readFile`.
   - This is preferred over the callback-based `fs.readFile` for async/await
     code.

2. **Reading the File**:
   - `await fs.readFile(opts.file, 'utf-8')` reads the file specified in
     `opts.file` and returns its contents as a string (thanks to the `'utf-8'`
     encoding).
   - If the file doesn't exist or there's another issue (e.g., permission
     denied), it throws an error.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - The `try/catch` block handles potential errors when reading the file. If an
     error occurs, it logs a user-friendly message and exits with a status code
     of `1` to indicate failure.
   - Common errors include `ENOENT` (file not found) or `EACCES` (permission
     denied), and `error.message` will provide a clear description.

4. **Using the File Content**:
   - `fileContent` holds the contents of the file as a string. You can use it in
     your logic (e.g., pass it as context to your LLM).
   - In this example, I log the first 100 characters of the file content for
     demonstration. Adjust this as needed for your use case.

5. **Type Adjustment**:
   - I changed `opts: { file?: string }` to `opts: { file: string }` since
     you're using `.requiredOption()` (as discussed earlier), meaning `file`
     will always be provided. If it's still optional in your actual setup, you
     can revert to `file?: string` and add a check like
     `if (!opts.file) { ... }`.

### Example Usage

Assuming this is part of your `codey` CLI tool with Commander.js:

- Command:
  ```bash
  node codey.js chat --file context.md "Hello, LLM!"
  ```
  Output (if `context.md` exists):
  ```
  Successfully read file: context.md
  File contents (first 100 chars): [first 100 characters of context.md]...
  Prompt: Hello, LLM!
  ```
  Output (if `context.md` does not exist):
  ```
  Error reading file context.md: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'context.md'
  ```

### Notes

- **File Encoding**: I used `'utf-8'` as the encoding to read the file as text,
  which is suitable for Markdown or plain text files. If you're dealing with
  binary files or other encodings, adjust accordingly.
- **Large Files**: `readFile` loads the entire file into memory, which is fine
  for most context files. For very large files, consider streaming with
  `fs.createReadStream()` instead, though itâ€™s more complex.
- **Path Resolution**: If users might provide relative paths, you can resolve
  them to absolute paths using `path.resolve(opts.file)` from the `path` module
  to avoid issues with the current working directory.

### Full Integration with Commander.js

Here's how it fits into a complete Commander.js setup:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node

import { Command } from "commander";
import { promises as fs } from "fs";
import { readStdin } from "../util/stdin.js";

const program = new Command();

program
  .name("codey")
  .description("A command-line tool for interacting with LLMs")
  .version("1.0.0");

program
  .command("chat")
  .description("Chat with the LLM using a prompt and context file")
  .argument(
    "[input]",
    "Prompt text to send to the LLM (optional; can be piped)",
  )
  .requiredOption("--file <file>", "Markdown file to use as context (required)")
  .action(async (input: string, options: { file: string }) => {
    await handleLog(input, options);
  });

async function handleLog(input: string | undefined, opts: { file: string }) {
  let promptText = input;
  if (!promptText && !process.stdin.isTTY) {
    promptText = (await readStdin()).trim();
  }
  if (!promptText) {
    console.error("No prompt supplied (argument or stdin required).");
    process.exit(1);
  }

  let fileContent: string;
  try {
    fileContent = await fs.readFile(opts.file, "utf-8");
    console.log(`Successfully read file: ${opts.file}`);
    console.log(
      `File contents (first 100 chars): ${fileContent.slice(0, 100)}...`,
    );
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error reading file ${opts.file}:`, error.message);
    process.exit(1);
  }

  console.log(`Prompt: ${promptText}`);
  // Add your LLM interaction logic here using promptText and fileContent
}

program.parse(process.argv);
```

This code ensures the file is read properly and integrates with your existing
logic for handling input and stdin. If you have further questions or need help
with additional features (like validating file extensions or handling multiple
files), let me know! ðŸ˜Š

# === USER ===

this code is a bit inefficient. for long files, it re-saves the entire file
contents. but actually, we should only be saving the new stuff, which is
strictly appended to the end of the file. can you please refactor this code to
append the file contents instead of replacing the entire file contents?

```typescript
import { promises as fs } from "fs";
import { generateChatCompletionStream } from "../util/ai.js";
import { withTimeout } from "../util/async.js";
import { parseChatLogFromText } from "../util/parse.js";
import { readStdin } from "../util/stdin.js";

export async function handleSave(
  input: string | undefined,
  opts: { file: string } = { file: "codey.md" },
) {
  let promptText = input;
  if (!promptText && !process.stdin.isTTY) {

  }

  fileContent += `${promptText}`;

  const { messages, settings } = parseChatLogFromText(fileContent);
  messages.push({
    role: "user",
    content: promptText,
  });

  try {
    const stream = await generateChatCompletionStream({
      messages,
      model: settings.model,
    });

    // add assistant delimiter to file content
    fileContent += `${settings.delimiterPrefix}${settings.assistantDelimiter}${settings.delimiterSuffix}`;

    for await (const textChunk of withTimeout(stream, 15_000)) {
      if (textChunk) {
        // print and also prepare to save to file
        process.stdout.write(textChunk);
        // fileContent += `\n\n${settings.delimiterPrefix}${settings.userDelimiter}${textChunk}${settings.delimiterSuffix}`;
        fileContent += textChunk;
      }
    }

    // add user delimiter to file content
    fileContent += `${settings.delimiterPrefix}${settings.userDelimiter}${settings.delimiterSuffix}`;

    process.stdout.write("\n");

    // write the updated content back to the file
    try {
      await fs.writeFile(opts.file, fileContent, "utf-8");
    } catch (writeErr) {
      console.error(`Failed to write to file ${opts.file}:`, writeErr);
      process.exit(1);
    }

    process.exit(0);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error generating chat completion:", err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

You're correct that rewriting the entire file content for long files is
inefficient, especially when new content is strictly appended to the end. We can
refactor the code to use `fs.appendFile` instead of `fs.writeFile` to append
only the new data (the user's prompt and the assistant's response) to the file.
This approach avoids reading and rewriting the entire file, improving
performance for large files.

Below, I'll refactor your `handleSave` function to append new content instead of
replacing the entire file. However, since you still need to parse the existing
file content to build the chat history (`messages`) for the LLM, we'll keep the
initial read operation. After that, we'll append the new user prompt and
assistant response directly to the file.

### Refactored Code to Append File Contents

```typescript
import { promises as fs } from "fs";
import { generateChatCompletionStream } from "../util/ai.js";
import { withTimeout } from "../util/async.js";
import { parseChatLogFromText } from "../util/parse.js";
import { readStdin } from "../util/stdin.js";

export async function handleSave(
  input: string | undefined,
  opts: { file: string } = { file: "codey.md" },
) {
  let promptText = input;
  if (!promptText && !process.stdin.isTTY) {
    promptText = (await readStdin()).trim();
  }
  if (!promptText) {
    console.error("No prompt supplied (argument or stdin required).");
    process.exit(1);
  }

  let fileContent = "";
  try {
    fileContent = await fs.readFile(opts.file, "utf-8");
  } catch (err: unknown) {
    // @ts-ignore
    if (err?.code === "ENOENT") {
      // File does not exist, we will create it later with writeFile
      fileContent = "";
    } else {
      console.error(`Failed to read file ${opts.file}:`, err);

    }
  }

  const { messages, settings } = parseChatLogFromText(fileContent);
  messages.push({
    role: "user",
    content: promptText,
  });

  try {
    const stream = await generateChatCompletionStream({
      messages,
      model: settings.model,
    });

    // Append user prompt to file
    const userEntry = `${promptText}`;
    try {
      if (fileContent === "") {
        // If file didn't exist or was empty, write the initial content
        await fs.writeFile(opts.file, userEntry, "utf-8");
      } else {
        // Otherwise, append the user entry
        await fs.appendFile(opts.file, userEntry, "utf-8");
      }
    } catch (writeErr) {
      console.error(
        `Failed to write user prompt to file ${opts.file}:`,
        writeErr,
      );
      process.exit(1);
    }

    // Append assistant delimiter before streaming response
    const assistantDelimiter = `${settings.delimiterPrefix}${settings.assistantDelimiter}${settings.delimiterSuffix}`;
    await fs.appendFile(opts.file, assistantDelimiter, "utf-8");

    let assistantResponse = "";
    for await (const textChunk of withTimeout(stream, 15_000)) {
      if (textChunk) {
        // Print to stdout
        process.stdout.write(textChunk);
        // Collect response to append in chunks or at once
        assistantResponse += textChunk;
        // Optionally, append in real-time (though this can be less efficient for many small writes)
        await fs.appendFile(opts.file, textChunk, "utf-8");
      }
    }

    // Append user delimiter after response
    const userDelimiter = `${settings.delimiterPrefix}${settings.userDelimiter}${settings.delimiterSuffix}`;
    await fs.appendFile(opts.file, userDelimiter, "utf-8");

    process.stdout.write("\n");

    process.exit(0);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error generating chat completion:", err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Initial Read Remains Necessary**:
   - We still need to read the entire file content initially (`fs.readFile`) to
     parse the chat history (`messages`) using `parseChatLogFromText`. This is
     unavoidable unless your `parseChatLogFromText` can work with partial data
     or you store chat history elsewhere.
   - If the file doesn't exist (`ENOENT`), we set `fileContent` to an empty
     string as before.

2. **Appending Instead of Overwriting**:
   - Instead of building `fileContent` as a string and using `fs.writeFile` to
     overwrite the entire file, we now use `fs.appendFile` to add new content
     (user prompt, assistant delimiter, assistant response, and user delimiter)
     directly to the end of the file.
   - If the file didn't exist or was empty, we use `fs.writeFile` for the first
     write to create it with the user prompt.

3. **Handling User Prompt**:
   - The user prompt (`promptText`) is appended (or written initially if the
     file is new) to the file right after it's validated.

4. **Streaming Assistant Response**:
   - The assistant's delimiter is appended before the response.
   - As the assistant's response streams in via `textChunk`, we append each
     chunk directly to the file using `fs.appendFile`. This avoids holding the
     entire response in memory before writing (though note the trade-off below).
   - Alternatively, you could collect `assistantResponse` and append it once at
     the end (commented in the code) if real-time appending causes too many I/O
     operations for small chunks.

5. **Final Delimiter**:
   - After the assistant response is complete, the user delimiter is appended to
     prepare for the next interaction.

6. **Performance Considerations**:
   - `fs.appendFile` is more efficient than `fs.writeFile` for large files
     because it doesn't rewrite existing content; it only adds data to the end.
   - Appending each `textChunk` in real-time may lead to many small I/O
     operations, which can be less efficient on some systems. If this becomes an
     issue, you can uncomment the approach of collecting `assistantResponse` and
     appending it once at the end.
   - We still read the full file once at the start, which is a bottleneck for
     very large files. If this is a significant concern, consider alternative
     strategies (see below).

### Trade-offs and Potential Improvements

- **Reading Large Files**: Since `parseChatLogFromText` requires the full file
  content to build `messages`, we can't avoid the initial read. If this becomes
  a performance issue, you could:
  - Store chat history in a database or separate log file instead of parsing
    from the main file.
  - Implement a streaming parser for `parseChatLogFromText` if possible, though
    this depends on the format and logic of your chat log.
  - Limit the history sent to the LLM by only parsing the last N messages or
    bytes from the file using a streaming approach with `fs.createReadStream`.

- **Real-time Appending**: Appending each `textChunk` ensures minimal memory
  usage but may result in many disk writes. If this is slow, batch the chunks or
  append the full `assistantResponse` at once.

- **Error Handling**: The code checks for errors during both reading and
  appending, ensuring the process exits with a failure code if anything goes
  wrong.

### Example Usage

Assuming `codey.md` exists with some content:

- Command:
  ```bash
  node codey.js chat --file codey.md "What's next?"
  ```
- Behavior:
  - Reads `codey.md` to parse existing messages.
  - Appends `"What's next?"` to `codey.md`.
  - Appends the assistant delimiter, streams and appends the assistant's
    response, then appends the user delimiter.
  - Only new content is written to the file via `appendFile`.

### Final Notes

This refactoring significantly reduces unnecessary writes by appending only new
content. However, the initial read remains a potential bottleneck for very large
files. If you can modify `parseChatLogFromText` or your data storage approach to
avoid reading the full file, that would further optimize performance.

If you have additional requirements (e.g., batching chunks, handling very large
files differently, or adjusting the format of appended data), let me know, and I
can refine the code further! ðŸ˜Š

# === USER ===

i've renamed this tool to `Chatvim CLI`. the command line name is `chatvim`.
`codey` has been deprecated and archived.

i need help with a feature i want to add to chatvim. the feature is called
"memory". so far, chatvim stores files on disk. you can also use a command
called `chatvim log` (previously `codey save`) to save the chat history to a
file.

now i want a new mode called `chatvim memory` where the chat history is saved in
the memory of the shell. one way this could work is that the history, which is
just a markdown file, is saved to an environment variable.

my question is, suppose the use calls multiple calls to `chatvim memory`,
without using `source`. can `chatvim memory` save data in an in-memory
environment variable in the current shell? or do i need to find another way to
store memory, possibly in a file in the user's global config, or a temporary
file in the current directory?

# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm glad to help with the rebranded `Chatvim CLI` and the new `memory` feature
for in-memory chat history storage. Let's address your question about storing
chat history in an environment variable for the `chatvim memory` command and
explore the feasibility and alternatives.

### Can `chatvim memory` Save Data in an In-Memory Environment Variable in the Current Shell?

The short answer is **no, not directly in the way you might be thinking**.
Node.js (or any program running in a shell) cannot modify the environment
variables of the parent shell (the current shell session) directly because
environment variables set by a child process (your Node.js script) are scoped to
that process and do not persist or affect the parent shell's environment after
the script exits. Let's break this down and then look at alternatives.

#### Why Environment Variables Don't Work for Persistent In-Memory Storage Across Calls

1. **Process Isolation**:
   - When you run `chatvim memory` (a Node.js script), it runs as a child
     process of your shell (e.g., Bash, Zsh, or PowerShell).
   - Any environment variable set within the Node.js process using
     `process.env.VAR_NAME = value` exists only for the duration of that process
     and is lost when the script exits.
   - Even if you could set an environment variable in the parent shell, it would
     not be "in-memory" in the sense of being invisible or transient; it would
     persist until the shell session ends or the variable is unset.

2. **Shell Behavior with `source`**:
   - If you use `source` (or `.` in Bash/Zsh), you can execute a script in the
     current shell context, allowing it to modify the shell's environment
     variables. However, since Node.js scripts aren't shell scripts, `source`
     won't work directly with them. You would need to output shell commands
     (e.g., `export CHATVIM_MEMORY="data"`) for the user to source manually,
     which is cumbersome and not user-friendly.

3. **Limitations of Environment Variables**:
   - Environment variables have size limits (often a few KB to MB depending on
     the system), which could be problematic for long chat histories.
   - They are not secure (visible to other processes via `/proc/self/environ` on
     Linux or similar mechanisms), though this might not be a concern for your
     use case.

Given these constraints, relying on environment variables for persistent
in-memory storage across multiple `chatvim memory` calls without `source` is not
feasible.

#### Alternatives for Implementing `chatvim memory`

Since direct in-memory storage via environment variables in the shell isn't
practical, here are several viable alternatives for implementing the `memory`
feature. Each has pros and cons, and the best choice depends on your
requirements for persistence, user experience, and performance.

##### 1. **Store Chat History in a Temporary File (Recommended for Simplicity)**

- **How It Works**:
  - Save the chat history to a temporary file in a system temp directory (e.g.,
    using Node.js's `os.tmpdir()` from the `os` module) or a fixed location like
    `~/.chatvim/memory.md`.
  - Use a unique identifier (e.g., a session ID based on timestamp or random
    string) to avoid conflicts if multiple `chatvim memory` sessions are active.
  - Read from and append to this file for each `chatvim memory` call.
  - Optionally, clean up the file after a timeout or when the user explicitly
    ends the session (e.g., with a `chatvim memory --clear` command).

- **Pros**:
  - Simple to implement using `fs` module (similar to your existing
    `chatvim log` logic with `appendFile`).
  - Persists across multiple calls without requiring shell environment
    modifications.
  - No size limits beyond disk space.
  - Works seamlessly in any shell environment.

- **Cons**:
  - Not truly "in-memory" since it writes to disk, though the performance impact
    is negligible for most use cases.
  - Temporary files might need cleanup logic to avoid cluttering the system.

- **Implementation Sketch**:
  ```typescript
  import { promises as fs } from "fs";
  import { tmpdir } from "os";
  import { join } from "path";

  const MEMORY_FILE = join(tmpdir(), "chatvim-memory.md");

  async function handleMemory(input: string, opts: { clear?: boolean }) {
    if (opts.clear) {
      await fs.unlink(MEMORY_FILE).catch(() => {}); // Ignore if file doesn't exist
      console.log("Memory cleared.");
      return;
    }

    let history = "";
    try {
      history = await fs.readFile(MEMORY_FILE, "utf-8");
    } catch (err) {
      history = ""; // File doesn't exist yet, start fresh
    }

    // Append new input to history
    history += `\nUser: ${input}\n`;
    // ... (process LLM response and append it too)

    await fs.writeFile(MEMORY_FILE, history, "utf-8");
    console.log("Chat history updated in memory (temp file).");
  }
  ```

##### 2. **Store Chat History in a User Config Directory File (Persistent Across Sessions)**

- **How It Works**:
  - Save the chat history to a file in the user's home directory, e.g.,
    `~/.chatvim/memory.md`, using a library like `os.homedir()` or a config
    directory library (`appdirs` or similar).
  - Similar to the temporary file approach but in a fixed, user-accessible
    location.
  - Allow users to clear or export this memory via additional commands (e.g.,
    `chatvim memory --clear` or `chatvim memory --export <file>`).

- **Pros**:
  - Persistent across shell sessions (user can pick up where they left off).
  - Easy to implement and integrates with existing file-based logic.
  - User can manually inspect or edit the memory file if desired.

- **Cons**:
  - Not "in-memory" since it's on disk.
  - Requires managing a permanent file, which might not align with the idea of
    transient memory.

- **Implementation Note**: Similar to the temporary file approach, but use
  `join(os.homedir(), '.chatvim', 'memory.md')` as the file path. Create the
  `.chatvim` directory if it doesn't exist using `fs.mkdir`.

##### 3. **Use an In-Memory Store with a Daemon or Background Process (Advanced)**

- **How It Works**:
  - Run a background Node.js process (a simple server or daemon) that holds the
    chat history in memory (e.g., in a JavaScript object or array).
  - `chatvim memory` communicates with this daemon via IPC (Inter-Process
    Communication), sockets, or a local HTTP endpoint to read/write chat
    history.
  - The daemon persists as long as the system or user keeps it running,
    providing true in-memory storage.

- **Pros**:
  - Truly in-memory storage, no disk writes.
  - Can be fast and avoids file I/O overhead.

- **Cons**:
  - Complex to implement (requires managing a background process, communication
    protocol, and lifecycle).
  - Memory is lost if the daemon crashes or is terminated.
  - Not user-friendly to set up or maintain for most users.

- **Implementation Note**: This is overkill for most CLI tools. Libraries like
  `pm2` (for managing background processes) or `socket.io` (for communication)
  could help, but it's not recommended unless you have a specific need for this
  complexity.

##### 4. **Output Shell Commands for User to Source (Manual Environment Variable Approach)**

- **How It Works**:
  - Instead of storing data directly, `chatvim memory` outputs a shell command
    (e.g., `export CHATVIM_MEMORY="data"` or a base64-encoded version for larger
    data) that the user must source manually or pipe to `eval`.
  - Example output:
    `echo 'export CHATVIM_MEMORY="history data"' | source /dev/stdin`
  - User would need to run or source this output to update the shell's
    environment.

- **Pros**:
  - Closest to modifying shell environment variables without a background store.
  - No disk writes if the user follows the instructions.

- **Cons**:
  - Extremely user-unfriendly; requires manual steps or scripting by the user.
  - Limited by environment variable size constraints.
  - Error-prone and not seamless.

- **Implementation Note**: Not recommended due to poor UX. If pursued, encode
  large data with base64 to handle special characters:
  `Buffer.from(history).toString('base64')`.

#### Recommendation

For the `chatvim memory` feature, I recommend **Option 1: Store Chat History in
a Temporary File**. It strikes the best balance between simplicity, performance,
and user experience. Here's why:

- It mimics "in-memory" behavior by being transient (temp files are often
  cleaned up by the OS or can be manually cleared).
- It's easy to implement with your existing file-handling logic (e.g.,
  `fs.appendFile` as in `chatvim log`).
- It works across multiple `chatvim memory` calls without requiring shell
  modifications or complex setups.
- No significant performance hit for typical chat history sizes.

If you want persistence across shell sessions (e.g., user closes terminal and
reopens), switch to **Option 2: User Config Directory File**.

#### Proposed Implementation for `chatvim memory` (Temporary File)

Here's a basic structure for adding the `memory` command to `Chatvim CLI` using
a temporary file. This assumes integration with your existing logic (like
`handleSave` but adapted for memory).

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node

import { Command } from "commander";
import { promises as fs } from "fs";
import { tmpdir } from "os";
import { join } from "path";
import { readStdin } from "./util/stdin.js";
import { parseChatLogFromText } from "./util/parse.js";
import { generateChatCompletionStream } from "./util/ai.js";
import { withTimeout } from "./util/async.js";

const program = new Command();
const MEMORY_FILE = join(tmpdir(), "chatvim-memory.md");

program
  .name("chatvim")
  .description("A command-line tool for interacting with LLMs")
  .version("1.0.0");

program
  .command("memory")
  .description("Chat with the LLM using in-memory history (stored in temp file)")
  .argument("[input]", "Prompt text to send to the LLM (optional; can be piped)")
  .option("--clear", "Clear the in-memory chat history")
  .action(async (input: string | undefined, options: { clear?: boolean }) => {
    await handleMemory(input, options);
  });

async function handleMemory(input: string | undefined, opts: { clear?: boolean }) {
  if (opts.clear) {
    try {
      await fs.unlink(MEMORY_FILE);
      console.log("In-memory chat history cleared.");
    } catch (err) {
      console.log("No in-memory chat history to clear.");
    }
    process.exit(0);
  }

  let promptText = input;
  if (!promptText && !process.stdin.isTTY) {
    promptText = (await readStdin()).trim();
  }
  if (!promptText) {
    console.error("No prompt supplied (argument or stdin required).");
    process.exit(1);
  }

  let fileContent = "";
  try {
    fileContent = await fs.readFile(MEMORY_FILE, "utf-8");
  } catch (err) {
    fileContent = ""; // File doesn't exist yet, start fresh
  }

  const { messages, settings } = parseChatLogFromText(fileContent);
  messages.push({
    role: "user",
    content: promptText,
  });

  try {
    const stream = await generateChatCompletionStream({
      messages,
      model: settings.model,
    });

    // Append user prompt to memory file
    const userEntry = `${promptText}`;
    if (fileContent === "") {
      await fs.writeFile(MEMORY_FILE, userEntry, "utf-8");
    } else {
      await fs.appendFile(MEMORY_FILE, userEntry, "utf-8");
    }

    // Append assistant delimiter
    const assistantDelimiter = `${settings.delimiterPrefix}${settings.assistantDelimiter}${settings.delimiterSuffix}`;
    await fs.appendFile(MEMORY_FILE, assistantDelimiter, "utf-8");

    for await (const textChunk of withTimeout(stream, 15_000)) {
      if (textChunk) {
        process.stdout.write(textChunk);
        await fs.appendFile(MEMORY_FILE, textChunk, "utf-8");
      }
    }

    // Append user delimiter
    const userDelimiter = `${settings.delimiterPrefix}${settings.userDelimiter}${settings.delimiterSuffix}`;
    await fs.appendFile(MEMORY_FILE, userDelimiter, "utf-8");

    process.stdout.write("\n");
    process.exit(0);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error("Error generating chat completion:", err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}

program.parse(process.argv);
```

#### Final Thoughts

This implementation uses a temporary file as a pseudo "in-memory" store, which
is the most practical approach. If you have a strong preference for avoiding
disk writes entirely, let me know, and I can explore a daemon-based solution
further, though it would be more complex. Additionally, if you'd like features
like exporting memory to a permanent file (`chatvim memory --export <file>`) or
setting a custom memory location, I can help with that too.

Let me know how you'd like to proceed or if you have other ideas for the
`memory` feature! ðŸ˜Š

# === USER ===

let's suppose i go with saving files per-shell in a global config directory. i
use nushell, but my question is for any shell. also, i use wezterm as a
terminal, but my question also goes for any terminal. is there a shell
environment variable i can access that uniquely identifies the current shell, so
that if i have two different shells, i can save the separate memory for each
shell to a file called somethin like `~/.chatvim/memory-<shell-id>.md`?

# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm glad to help with implementing the `chatvim memory` feature using a global
config directory with per-shell memory files. Your goal is to uniquely identify
each shell instance (or terminal session) to store separate chat histories in
files like `~/.chatvim/memory-<shell-id>.md`. Let's explore whether there's a
shell environment variable or another mechanism to uniquely identify the current
shell across different shells (like Nushell, Bash, Zsh, etc.) and terminals
(like WezTerm, iTerm2, etc.).

### Is There a Shell Environment Variable to Uniquely Identify the Current Shell?

The short answer is **not universally, but partially yes with caveats**. There
isn't a single, standardized environment variable across all shells and
terminals that uniquely identifies a specific shell instance. However, there are
shell-specific and terminal-specific variables or mechanisms that can help
approximate this, though they may not be perfect for all use cases. Let's break
this down and then propose a solution.

#### Shell-Specific Identifiers

1. **Bash/Zsh (and similar POSIX shells)**:
   - **$$ (Process ID - PID)**: In most POSIX-compliant shells (Bash, Zsh, etc.), the `$$
     `variable holds the Process ID (PID) of the current shell process. This is unique for each shell instance while it is running. You can access this via the environment variable`BASHPID`in Bash or directly as`$$`
     in scripts.
   - **Environment Variable**: You can access this in Node.js via
     `process.env.BASHPID` (in Bash) or by reading `/proc/self/stat` on Linux to
     get the PID if needed.
   - **Limitation**: PIDs are unique only while the shell is running. If a shell
     exits and a new one starts, the PID could be reused by the system for
     another process. Also, not all shells export this consistently as an
     environment variable (e.g., `$$` might need to be passed explicitly).

2. **Nushell**:
   - Nushell does not directly expose a built-in variable like `$$` for the
     shell's PID in the same way as Bash. However, you can get the PID of the
     current Nushell process by running an external command like `ps` or by
     accessing system information.
   - **Environment Variable**: Nushell allows you to access environment
     variables via `std::env::var("VAR_NAME")` in scripts, but there's no
     default variable for shell PID. You can set a custom variable or use an
     external command to fetch the PID.
   - **Limitation**: Similar to Bash, PIDs are not guaranteed to be unique over
     time due to reuse.

3. **PowerShell**:
   - PowerShell provides `$PID` as a built-in variable representing the current
     process ID.
   - **Environment Variable**: Accessible in Node.js via `process.env` if
     exported, though PowerShell doesn't export it by default unless scripted.
   - **Limitation**: Same PID reuse issue.

4. **General Issue with PIDs**:
   - PIDs are unique only within a single system session (until reboot or PID
     wraparound). If a shell exits and a new one starts, the system might reuse
     the same PID for a different process, leading to potential file conflicts
     or overwrites if not handled carefully.
   - PIDs are not consistent across different shells or platforms (e.g., Windows
     vs. Linux).

#### Terminal-Specific Identifiers

Terminals like WezTerm, iTerm2, or GNOME Terminal sometimes provide environment
variables that can help identify a terminal instance, but these are not
standardized and vary widely:

1. **WezTerm**:
   - WezTerm sets environment variables like `WEZTERM_PANE` (unique ID for a
     pane within a terminal session) and `WEZTERM_UNIX_SOCKET` (path to a socket
     for the terminal instance).
   - **Access**: In Node.js, check `process.env.WEZTERM_PANE` for a
     pane-specific ID.
   - **Limitation**: This identifies a pane, not necessarily a shell instance.
     If multiple tabs or panes run shells, they might have different IDs but
     belong to the same terminal session. Also, this is WezTerm-specific and
     won't work in other terminals.

2. **Other Terminals**:
   - **iTerm2**: Sets `ITERM_SESSION_ID` for each session.
   - **GNOME Terminal**: May set `GNOME_TERMINAL_SCREEN` or similar.
   - **Limitation**: These are terminal-specific and not portable. If a user
     switches terminals, the identifier changes or may not exist.

#### Cross-Shell and Cross-Terminal Challenges

- There is no universal environment variable that uniquely identifies a shell
  instance across all shells and terminals.
- Relying on PIDs (like `$$` or `BASHPID`) is the closest to a portable solution
  for shells, but it has the risk of PID reuse and isn't guaranteed to be
  exported as an environment variable in all shells (e.g., Nushell requires
  extra steps).
- Terminal-specific variables (like `WEZTERM_PANE`) are useful but not portable
  across different terminal emulators.

#### Recommended Solution: Combine PID with a Fallback or Custom ID

Given the lack of a universal identifier, I recommend a hybrid approach to
approximate a unique shell identifier for storing per-shell memory files in
`~/.chatvim/memory-<shell-id>.md`. Here's the strategy:

1. **Use Shell PID as Primary Identifier**:
   - Attempt to get the shell's PID via environment variables (`BASHPID` for
     Bash, or a general fallback).
   - On systems where `process.env.BASHPID` isn't set (e.g., Nushell), use
     Node.js's `process.pid` (the PID of the Node.js process, which is a child
     of the shell and thus unique per invocation, though not the shell's PID).
   - Alternatively, read the parent PID (shell's PID) via system calls (e.g.,
     `/proc/self/stat` on Linux or `ps` command output).

2. **Fallback to Terminal-Specific Identifiers**:
   - If available, use terminal-specific variables like `WEZTERM_PANE` or
     `ITERM_SESSION_ID` as a secondary identifier.
   - Combine with PID if needed to increase uniqueness.

3. **Add a Timestamp or Random ID for Safety**:
   - To mitigate PID reuse, append a timestamp (e.g., `Date.now()`) or a random
     string to the identifier to ensure uniqueness even if PIDs are reused.

4. **Store in Global Config Directory**:
   - Use the user's home directory (via `os.homedir()`) to create a `~/.chatvim`
     directory and store memory files as `memory-<shell-id>.md`.

This approach ensures a reasonably unique identifier for each shell instance
while handling edge cases.

#### Implementation in Node.js/TypeScript for `chatvim memory`

Here's a sample implementation for `Chatvim CLI` that creates per-shell memory
files in a global config directory using a hybrid identifier.

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node

import { Command } from "commander";
import { promises as fs } from "fs";
import { homedir } from "os";
import { join } from "path";
import { readStdin } from "./util/stdin.js";

const program = new Command();

// Global config directory for Chatvim
const CONFIG_DIR = join(homedir(), ".chatvim");

#### Explanation of the Implementation

1. **Config Directory**:
   - Memory files are stored in `~/.chatvim/`, created if it doesn't exist using
     `fs.mkdir` with `recursive: true`.

2. **Shell ID Generation**:
   - `getShellId()` combines the shell PID (from `BASHPID` or `process.pid`),
     terminal-specific ID (like `WEZTERM_PANE` or `ITERM_SESSION_ID`), and a
     timestamp to create a unique identifier.
   - The ID is sanitized to be filename-safe by replacing non-alphanumeric
     characters with hyphens.
   - This approach minimizes the risk of conflicts even if PIDs are reused.

3. **Memory File Path**:
   - Each shell instance gets a unique file named `memory-<shell-id>.md` in
     `~/.chatvim/`.

4. **Features**:
   - `--clear`: Deletes the memory file for the current shell.
   - `--list`: Lists all memory files in `~/.chatvim/` to help users see active
     memory sessions (useful for cleanup if old files accumulate).
   - Regular usage appends to or creates the memory file for the shell.

5. **Cross-Shell/Terminal Compatibility**:
   - This works in Nushell, Bash, Zsh, PowerShell, etc., because it falls back
     to `process.pid` if no shell-specific PID is available.
   - It supports WezTerm and other terminals by incorporating terminal IDs when
     available.

#### Limitations and Considerations

- **PID Reuse**: While the timestamp mitigates this, there's a small chance of
  ID collision if two shells start at the exact same millisecond with reused
  PIDs. If this is a concern, use a UUID or random string instead of a
  timestamp.
- **Old Memory Files**: Over time, `~/.chatvim/` may accumulate old memory files
  from closed shells. You can add a `--clean-all` option to delete all memory
  files or implement a TTL (time-to-live) by checking file modification times.
- **Nushell-Specific**: Since Nushell doesn't export a PID variable by default,
  `process.pid` (Node.js process ID) is used as a fallback. This is unique per
  invocation but not the shell's PID. If you need the exact shell PID in
  Nushell, you can run an external command like `ps` and parse the parent PID,
  though this adds complexity.

#### Final Recommendation

This hybrid approach (PID + Terminal ID + Timestamp) provides a practical way to
uniquely identify shell instances for per-shell memory files in a global config
directory. It works across shells (including Nushell) and terminals (including
WezTerm) with minimal risk of conflict. The implementation includes
user-friendly options like `--clear` and `--list` to manage memory files.

If you want to refine this further (e.g., better cleanup of old files, a more
robust ID generation, or integration with your existing chat history logic), let

# === USER ===

ok, since this will depend on someone's setup, i think i'm going to have to
solve another problem pertaining to global user configuration.

in order to solve this, i have a tangential question. is there a standard way to
do "deep merge" on javascript/tyepscript objects? basically, config is saved in
an object with optional parameters. i want the user to be able to save this
config as the toml front matter of a markdown file in a global config directory
for chatvim. this data will be loaded and then "deep merged" into any subsequent
source of configuration. how best do i do deep merge of objects in typescript?
also note that this deep merged object will be parsed through zod.

# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm happy to help with implementing a global user configuration system for
`Chatvim CLI` and addressing your question about deep merging
JavaScript/TypeScript objects. Let's explore the concept of deep merging, how to
implement it safely in TypeScript, and how to integrate it with TOML front
matter in a Markdown file and Zod for validation.

### What is Deep Merging, and Why Do We Need It?

Deep merging is a process of combining two or more objects recursively, where
nested properties are merged rather than overwritten. For example, if you have a
default configuration object and a user-provided configuration object, deep
merging ensures that nested properties in the user config supplement or override
the corresponding nested properties in the default config, rather than replacing
entire nested objects.

In your case, you want to:

- Load a default configuration.
- Load a user configuration from TOML front matter in a Markdown file stored in
  a global config directory (e.g., `~/.chatvim/config.md`).
- Deep merge the user config into the default config to create a final
  configuration.
- Validate the merged configuration using Zod to ensure it adheres to your
  schema.

### Is There a Standard Way to Do Deep Merge in JavaScript/TypeScript?

There isn't a built-in "standard" method for deep merging objects in JavaScript
or TypeScript. However, there are well-established patterns and libraries that
can handle this effectively. I'll outline the options and provide a recommended
solution that works with TypeScript and integrates with Zod.

#### Options for Deep Merging

1. **Manual Implementation**:
   - Write a custom recursive function to merge objects, handling nested
     properties, arrays, and edge cases (like null values or non-object types).
   - Pros: Full control over merging logic.
   - Cons: Time-consuming to write and test; prone to edge-case bugs.

2. **Using Libraries**:
   - Popular libraries like `lodash` (`_.merge`), `deepmerge`, or `merge-deep`
     provide robust deep merging capabilities.
   - Pros: Well-tested, handles edge cases, and supports customization.
   - Cons: Adds a dependency to your project.

3. **Spread Operator (Shallow Merge)**:
   - The spread operator (`...`) can merge objects, but it only performs a
     shallow merge, overwriting nested objects rather than merging them.
   - Pros: Built-in, no dependencies.
   - Cons: Not suitable for deep merging.

#### Recommended Approach: Use `deepmerge` Library

For most projects, using a library like `deepmerge` is the best balance of
simplicity, reliability, and maintainability. `deepmerge` is lightweight,
TypeScript-friendly (with type definitions available), and handles common deep
merging scenarios well. It also allows customization of merge behavior (e.g.,
how arrays are handled).

### Step-by-Step Solution for Deep Merging with TypeScript, TOML, and Zod

Below, I'll provide a complete solution for:

- Loading a default config.
- Reading a user config from TOML front matter in a Markdown file.
- Deep merging the user config into the default config using `deepmerge`.
- Validating the merged config with Zod.

#### 1. Install Required Dependencies

You'll need the following packages:

- `deepmerge` for merging objects.
- `@iarna/toml` for parsing TOML front matter from Markdown.
- `zod` for schema validation.
- `fs` and `path` (built-in) for file operations.

Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install deepmerge @iarna/toml zod
```

#### 2. Define a Zod Schema for Configuration

First, define the structure of your configuration using Zod. This ensures that
the merged configuration adheres to the expected shape and types.

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

// Define the configuration schema with Zod
const ConfigSchema = z.object({
  chat: z.object({
    model: z.string().default("gpt-4"),
    temperature: z.number().min(0).max(1).default(0.7),
    delimiters: z.object({
      user: z.string().default("User:"),
      assistant: z.string().default("Assistant:"),
      prefix: z.string().default("\n\n"),
      suffix: z.string().default("\n\n"),
    }),
  }),
  memory: z.object({
    enabled: z.boolean().default(true),
    mode: z.enum(["temp", "config", "none"]).default("config"),
  }),
});

// Type for the validated config
export type ChatvimConfig = z.infer<typeof ConfigSchema>;
```

#### 3. Implement Deep Merging with `deepmerge`

Use `deepmerge` to combine the default configuration with the user
configuration. We'll also handle loading the user config from a Markdown file
with TOML front matter.

```typescript
import deepmerge from "deepmerge";
import { promises as fs } from "fs";
import { homedir } from "os";
import { join } from "path";
import * as toml from "@iarna/toml";
import { z } from "zod";
import { ChatvimConfig, ConfigSchema } from "./configSchema";

// Default configuration
const defaultConfig: ChatvimConfig = {
  chat: {
    model: "gpt-4",
    temperature: 0.7,
    delimiters: {
      user: "User:",
      assistant: "Assistant:",
      prefix: "\n\n",
      suffix: "\n\n",
    },
  },
  memory: {
    enabled: true,
    mode: "config",
  },
};

// Global config directory and file for Chatvim
const CONFIG_DIR = join(homedir(), ".chatvim");
const CONFIG_FILE = join(CONFIG_DIR, "config.md");

// Ensure config directory exists
const ensureConfigDir = async () => {
  try {
    await fs.mkdir(CONFIG_DIR, { recursive: true });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`Failed to create config directory ${CONFIG_DIR}:`, err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
};

// Parse TOML front matter from Markdown file
const parseTomlFrontMatter = async (
  filePath: string,
): Promise<Record<string, unknown> | null> => {
  try {
    const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, "utf-8");
    const frontMatterMatch = content.match(/^---\n([\s\S]*?)\n---/);
    if (frontMatterMatch && frontMatterMatch[1]) {
      return toml.parse(frontMatterMatch[1]) as Record<string, unknown>;
    }
    return null;
  } catch (err) {
    console.warn(`Failed to read or parse config file ${filePath}:`, err);
    return null;
  }
};

// Load and merge configuration
export const loadConfig = async (): Promise<ChatvimConfig> => {
  await ensureConfigDir();

  // Load user config from TOML front matter in config.md
  let userConfig: Partial<ChatvimConfig> = {};
  const userToml = await parseTomlFrontMatter(CONFIG_FILE);
  if (userToml) {
    userConfig = userToml as Partial<ChatvimConfig>;
  }

  // Deep merge default and user config
  const mergedConfig = deepmerge(defaultConfig, userConfig, {
    // Optional: Customize array merging (default is to overwrite)
    arrayMerge: (_destinationArray, sourceArray) => sourceArray,
  });

  // Validate merged config with Zod
  const parsedConfig = ConfigSchema.parse(mergedConfig);
  return parsedConfig;
};
```

#### 4. Example Usage in `Chatvim CLI`

Integrate the configuration loader into your CLI setup with Commander.js or your
main logic.

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node

import { Command } from "commander";
import { loadConfig } from "./config";

const program = new Command();

program
  .name("chatvim")
  .description("A command-line tool for interacting with LLMs")
  .version("1.0.0");

program
  .command("init")
  .description("Initialize or display current configuration")
  .action(async () => {
    const config = await loadConfig();
    console.log("Current Chatvim Configuration:");
    console.log(JSON.stringify(config, null, 2));
    process.exit(0);
  });

// Add other commands (e.g., memory, chat) that use the config
program
  .command("memory")
  .description("Chat with the LLM using per-shell memory")
  .argument("[input]", "Prompt text to send to the LLM")
  .action(async (input: string | undefined) => {
    const config = await loadConfig();
    console.log(`Using memory mode: ${config.memory.mode}`);
    // Add your memory logic here, using config
    process.exit(0);
  });

program.parse(process.argv);
```

#### 5. Example User Config File (`~/.chatvim/config.md`)

The user can create or edit a file at `~/.chatvim/config.md` with TOML front
matter to override parts of the default configuration.

```markdown
---
chat:
  model: "gpt-3.5-turbo"
  temperature: 0.9
  delimiters:
    user: "Me:"
    assistant: "Bot:"
memory:
  mode: "temp"
---

# Chatvim Configuration Notes

This is the user configuration for Chatvim CLI. Edit the TOML above to customize
settings.
```

When `loadConfig()` runs, it will:

- Load the default config.
- Parse the TOML front matter from `~/.chatvim/config.md` (if it exists).
- Deep merge the user config into the default config (e.g., `model` becomes
  `"gpt-3.5-turbo"`, `temperature` becomes `0.9`, but unspecified fields like
  `delimiters.prefix` remain from the default).
- Validate the merged result with Zod to ensure type safety.

#### Explanation of Key Points

1. **Deep Merging with `deepmerge`**:
   - `deepmerge(defaultConfig, userConfig)` recursively merges nested objects.
   - The optional `arrayMerge` customization specifies how arrays are handled
     (here, user arrays overwrite default arrays; you can change this to
     concatenate or use other logic).
   - `deepmerge` handles null/undefined values gracefully and preserves nested
     structure.

2. **TOML Front Matter Parsing**:
   - Uses `@iarna/toml` to parse the TOML section between `---` delimiters in
     the Markdown file.
   - If the file doesn't exist or parsing fails, it falls back to an empty
     object, so the default config is used.

3. **Zod Validation**:
   - After merging, `ConfigSchema.parse(mergedConfig)` validates the result,
     throwing an error if the structure is invalid.
   - Zod's `default()` values ensure that missing fields in the merged config
     are filled with defaults, though `deepmerge` typically handles this already
     via the `defaultConfig`.

4. **TypeScript Safety**:
   - The `ChatvimConfig` type (inferred from Zod) ensures type safety throughout
     your application.
   - `deepmerge` supports TypeScript with proper type definitions if you install
     `@types/deepmerge` or use the built-in types from recent versions.

#### Handling Edge Cases

- **Missing Config File**: If `~/.chatvim/config.md` doesn't exist,
  `parseTomlFrontMatter` returns `null`, and the default config is used.
- **Invalid TOML**: If the TOML is malformed, a warning is logged, and the
  default config is used.
- **Conflicting Types**: `deepmerge` overwrites values with user-provided ones,
  but Zod ensures the final structure matches your schema. If a user provides an
  invalid value (e.g., `temperature: "invalid"`), Zod will throw a validation
  error.
- **Custom Merge Logic**: If you need special handling (e.g., merging arrays by
  concatenating instead of overwriting), customize `deepmerge` options as shown.

#### Alternative: Manual Deep Merge Implementation

If you prefer not to use a library, here's a simple manual deep merge function
for TypeScript. However, note that itâ€™s less robust than `deepmerge` for complex
cases (e.g., circular references, special types).

```typescript
function deepMerge<T>(target: T, source: Partial<T>): T {
  const output = { ...target };
  for (const key in source) {
    if (Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(source, key)) {
      const sourceValue = source[key];
      const targetValue = output[key];
      if (
        sourceValue &&
        typeof sourceValue === "object" &&
        !Array.isArray(sourceValue) &&
        targetValue &&
        typeof targetValue === "object" &&
        !Array.isArray(targetValue)
      ) {
        output[key] = deepMerge(targetValue, sourceValue);
      } else if (sourceValue !== undefined) {
        output[key] = sourceValue;
      }
    }
  }
  return output;
}
```

You can replace `deepmerge` with this function in the `loadConfig` function,
though I recommend sticking with `deepmerge` for production use.

#### Final Recommendations

- Use `deepmerge` for deep merging due to its reliability and TypeScript
  support.
- Store user configuration in `~/.chatvim/config.md` with TOML front matter for
  easy editing and compatibility with Markdown.
- Validate the merged config with Zod to catch errors early and ensure type
  safety.
- Add a `chatvim config` or `chatvim init` command to help users create or view
  their config file, improving UX.

If you have specific requirements for merge behavior (e.g., how to handle arrays
or specific fields), need help with writing the initial config file, or want to
explore other libraries or formats (e.g., JSON instead of TOML), let me know! ðŸ˜Š
